  <section class="main-section" id="C_Basic_Syntax">
    
    <header>C Basic Syntax</header>
 
    <p>
You have seen a basic structure of C program, so it will be easy to understand other
basic building blocks of the C programming language.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Tokens_in_C">
  <header>Tokens in C</header>
  <p>
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a
constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of
five tokens:
  </p>
    <br>
    <code>
printf("Hello, World! \n");
    </code>
    <br>
The individual tokens are:
    <br>
    <code>
printf
(
"Hello, World! \n"
) ;
    </code>
    <br>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Semicolons">
      <header>Semicolons</header>
      <p>
In C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement
must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
For example, following are two different statements:
      </p>
    <code>
printf("Hello, World! \n");
return 0;
    </code>
    </section>
<section class="main-section" id="Comments">
  <header>Comments</header>
  <p>
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler.
They start with /* and terminates with the characters */ as shown below:
/* my first program in C */
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or
character literals.
  </p>
    </section>
<section class="main-section" id="Identifiers">
  <header>Identifiers</header>
  <p>
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined
item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero
or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case
sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different
identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers:
mohd zara abc move_name a_123
myname50 _temp j a23b9 retVal
  </p>
   
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Keywords">
      <header>Keywords</header>
    
    <p>
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as
constant or variable or any other identifier names.
auto else Long switch
break enum register typedef
case extern return union
char float short unsigned
const for signed void
continue goto sizeof volatile
default if static while
do int struct _packed
</p>
    
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Whitespace_in_C">
      <header>Whitespace in C</header>
    
    <p>
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a
C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and
comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the
compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next
element begins. Therefore, in the following statement:
</p>
    <br>
    <code>
int age;
    </code>
    <br>
    <p>
    There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for
the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement:
</p>
    <br>
    <code>
      fruit = apples + oranges; // get the total fruit
    </code>
<br>
<p>
No whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples,
although you are free to include some if you wish for readability purpose.
</p>
    </>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="C_Data_Types">
    <header>C Data Types</header>
    
    <p>
    In the C programming language, data types refer to an extensive system used for
declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how
much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows:
S.N. Types and Description
</p>
<p>
1
Basic Types:
They are arithmetic types and consists of the two types: (a) integer types and (b) floatingpoint types.
</p>
<p>
2
Enumerated types:
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only be
assigned certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
</p>
<p>
3 The type void:
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
</p>
<p>
4
Derived types:
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and
</p>
<p>
(e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred to collectively as the aggregate types. The
type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see basic types
in the following section, whereas, other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Integer_Types">
  <header>Integer Types</header>
  <p>
Following table gives you details about standard integer types with its storage sizes and
value ranges:
Type Storage size Value range
Char 1 byte -128 to 127 or 0 to 255
unsigned char 1 byte 0 to 255
signed char 1 byte -128 to 127
Int 2 or 4 bytes -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned int 2 or 4 bytes 0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
Short 2 bytes -32,768 to 32,767
unsigned short 2 bytes 0 to 65,535
Long 4 bytes -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
unsigned long 4 bytes 0 to 4,294,967,295
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use
the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or
type in bytes. Following is an example to get the size of int type on any machine:
  </p>
    <code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int main()
{
printf("Storage size for int : %d \n", sizeof(int));
return 0;
}
      </code>
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on
Linux:
Storage size for int : 4
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Floating-Point_Types">
  <header>Floating-Point Types</header>
Following table gives you details about standard floating-point types with storage sizes and
value ranges and their precision:
Type Storage size Value range Precision
float 4 byte 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38 6 decimal places
double 8 byte 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308 15 decimal places
long double 10 byte 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932 19 decimal places
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details
about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. Following example will
print storage space taken by a float type and its range values:
      <code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <float.h>
int main()

{
printf("Storage size for float : %d \n", sizeof(float));
printf("Minimum float positive value: %E\n", FLT_MIN );
printf("Maximum float positive value: %E\n", FLT_MAX );
printf("Precision value: %d\n", FLT_DIG );
return 0;
}
        </code>
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on
Linux:
Storage size for float : 4
Minimum float positive value: 1.175494E-38
Maximum float positive value: 3.402823E+38
Precision value: 6
   
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="The_void_Type">
          <header>The void Type</header>
       
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations:
S.N. Types and Description
1
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return value or you can say they return void.
A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int
status);
2
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no
parameter can accept as a void. For example, int rand(void);
3
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example,
a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which
can be casted to any data type.
The void type may not be understood to you at this point, so let us proceed and we will
cover these concepts in the upcoming chapters.
  
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="C_Variables">
    <header>C Variables</header>
    
    Avariable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can
manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of
the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the
set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It
must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct
because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in previous chapter, there
will be the following basic variable types:

Char Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type.
Int The most natural size of integer for the machine.
Float A single-precision floating point value.
Double A double-precision floating point value.
Void Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we
will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc.
For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.

        </section> 
        <section class="main-section" id="C_Constants_and_Literals">
         <header>C Constants and Literals</header>
       
          The constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its
execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating
constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are also enumeration
constants as well.
The constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be
modified after their definition.
     
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Integer_literals">
 <header>Integer literals</header>
   
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the
base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and
long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals:
      
          <code>
         
212 /* Legal */
215u /* Legal */
0xFeeL /* Legal */
078 /* Illegal: 8 is not an octal digit */
032UU /* Illegal: cannot repeat a suffix */
Following are other examples of various types of Integer literals:
85 /* decimal */
0213 /* octal */
0x4b /* hexadecimal */
30 /* int */
30u /* unsigned int */
30l /* long */
30ul /* unsigned long */
</pre>
          </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="C_Operators">
          <header>C Operators</header>
       
          An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical
manipulations. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of
<ul>
operators:
<li>Arithmetic Operators </li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Misc Operators </li>
</ul>
 
This tutorial will explain the arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment and other
operators one by one.
Arithmetic Operators
Following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by C language. Assume
variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:
Operator Description Example

      
+ Adds two operands A + B will give 30
- Subtracts second operand from the first A - B will give -10
* Multiplies both operands A * B will give 200
/ Divides numerator by de-numerator B / A will give 2
% Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division B % A will give 0
